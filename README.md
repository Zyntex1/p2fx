# P2FX
**P2FX** is a plugin based on [SourceAutoRecord](https://github.com/p2sr/SourceAutoRecord) for creating Portal 2 videos.

## Installation
- Download the newest release from [here](https://github.com/Zyntex1/p2fx/releases).
- Place it next to Portal 2's executable (typically in `SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Portal 2`).
- Add `+mat_hdr_level 3` to the game's launch options (or else some effects will not work).
- Open the game and type `plugin_load p2fx` in the console.

## Support
**P2FX** currently does not support any operating system other than **Windows**. The plugin only works on Portal 2, no other modifications. **P2FX** is not intended to be used with any other plugins loaded.
